            <p>Thangalaan (transl. The Son of Gold) is an upcoming Indian Tamil-language historical action drama film directed by Pa. Ranjith and produced by K. E. Gnanavel Raja under Studio Green and Neelam Productions. The film stars Vikram in the titular role, alongside Pasupathy, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Malavika Mohanan, Daniel Caltagirone and Harikrishnan Anbudurai.

                The film was officially announced in December 2021 under the tentative title Chiyaan 61, as it is Vikram's 61st film as a lead actor, and the official title was announced in October 2022. Principal photography commenced the same month. It was shot sporadically in several legs, with filming locations including Chennai, Andhra Pradesh, Madurai, Karnataka, and wrapped by early-July 2023. The film has music composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, cinematography handled by A. Kishor Kumar and editing by Selva RK.
                
                Thangalaan was initially scheduled to release on 26 January 2024, coinciding Republic Day, but was postponed as the makers wanted it to be screened at film festivals before the theatrical release. It is now scheduled to release in April 2024 in theatres.</p>
